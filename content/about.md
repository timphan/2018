Welcome to my personal web site! I'm Timothy (or just Tim) Phan.

I'm currently a political activist and organizer based in Los Angeles and Orange County.

I built this website to archive and document my journey into community organizing. Alternatively, I also enjoy snark-tweeting about Game of Thrones memes if you're into that as well. Season 8, cannot wait...

Feel free to reach out if you've got any questions! Ping me if you're interested in progressive politics, Democratic Party stuff in LA/OC, and grassroots activism in my Asian-American community.

Thanks for stopping by!
