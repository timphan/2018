I recently finished an organizing internship with the Korean Resource Center. It has been an honor to stand among such dedicated and talented activists in the AAPI community to fight for immigration justice against an administration so openly hostile to our communities.

The 2018 elections will be an important checkpoint on the progressive movement's resistance against the Trump administration, but the larger work of organizing towards justice and equality transcend any one election. I am dedicated to exploring the intersections of racial injustice and economic inequality in the very local contexts of both Los Angeles and Orange County.
