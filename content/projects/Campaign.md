I love volunteering and assisting in many political campaigns as possible! Nothing like a good old GOTV...

Since my involvement with the Hillary Clinton campaign ended in November of 2016, I've come back home to Southern California with a dedicated interest in supporting quality candidates in my local community. I proudly volunteered for Sara Hernandez in the CD 34 race, Frank Yokoyama for his successful bid to the Cerritos City Council, and Mike Fong's bid for the AD51 race. 

I've also been active in the CA-39 and CA-45 districts as a member of those districts' "Action Councils", as I am highly supportive of multiple Democrats in both races to replace Congressmembers Ed Royce and Mimi Walters. I also strongly believe in supporting down-ballot candidates at the municipal level in Orange County to build a broader progressive infrastructure.

I'm also on the board of the California Young Democrats' API Caucus, the Los Angeles County Asian American and Pacific Islander Democrats, the Vietnamese American Democratic Club of Orange County, and the Orange County Young Democrats. Feel free to ask me about any of those orgs and how to get more involved there.
