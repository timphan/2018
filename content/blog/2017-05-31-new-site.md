Switched to Hugo because people at #runconf17 were talking about it. LOL

I liked my previous platform on Jekyll + Github Pages, but I wasn't really posting much on it anyways. I really like using the RStudio tools, consider this a shoutout to my R community.

Thanks to Yihue Xie and Amber Thomas for the [blogdown package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), (and also for Amber's helpful [tutorial](https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/#site-configuration')), and Vicky Laiio for the [Hugo theme](https://github.com/vickylaiio/hugo-theme-introduction?utm_content=buffer5a39d&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer').
