      <description>Switched to Hugo because people at #runconf17 were talking about it. LOL
I liked my previous platform on Jekyll + Github Pages, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really posting much on it anyways. I really like using the RStudio tools, consider this a shoutout to my R community.
Thanks to Yihue Xie and Amber Thomas for the blogdown package, (and also for Amber&amp;rsquo;s helpful tutorial), and Vicky Laiio for the Hugo theme.</description>

      <description>So much for writing about the election this year. I just moved to Tampa to join Hillary Clinton and the Florida Democrats, I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on the data and analytics team for the duration of the election. Volunteering as a fellow during the California primary for HRC will always be a highlight of my life, and I&amp;rsquo;m really thankful for all the great people I met.
But now the hardest part comes next.</description>
